						<h3>What is Cyber Attack?</h3>
						<p>Cyber attack is a VR game that combines two different types of gameplays. The first one is a time-based board game: players wait for their turns, roll the dice and move their pawns. The second gameplay comes in  when, during a player's turn, a mystery die decides to trap them inside the board, where it turns into a first person shooter. Here, the player has to explore a maze to find and hack terminals in order to get back out.</p>
						<h3>Story</h3>
						<p>A team of astronauts is on a mission in outer space when, out of nowhere, their ship's AI system decides they are no longer necessary and kicks them out of the spacecraft! However, they won't give up that easily. They will fight back and try to hack their way back into the spaceship.</p>
						<p>As they hack back some of the service bots in the ship, they  will have to move strategically to get rid of the infected bots and reach the main virus affecting the AI before they run out of oxygen.</p>
