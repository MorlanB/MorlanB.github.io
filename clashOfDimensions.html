						<h3>About the App.</h3>
						<p>
							In Clash of Dimensions, the player starts in their real-world location, but things quickly take a turn when walls around them come down, revealing a Middle Earth-like world. Waves of orcs begin attacking, damaging the player’s battlement walls and the player themselves. The player must use their own weapons, cast spells, and trigger environmental traps to survive as many waves as possible.
							<h3>Creating the app...</h3>
<p>
							<b>Gameplay Systems. </b> As a solo developer on this prototype, I focused on building simple but functional systems that made the game feel cohesive. I implemented core mechanics like damage and repair, spell charging and casting, virtual wall placement, and basic enemy AI. This approach allowed us to quickly pivot the design without wasting time on fundamental system changes.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Meta APIs. </b> To seamlessly blend the real world with the virtual environment, I integrated Meta’s Scene and Depth APIs, working around their limitations and addressing bugs to ensure smooth functionality and continuous updates
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Gesture Based Spell Casting.</b> One of my favorite mechanics to implement! Players receive spell cards that they can activate by drawing specific shapes in front of them. I used a gesture recognition tool, collecting over 30 samples per spell to improve accuracy, and linked this system to the spell casting mechanics for a smooth experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Asset Creation and Integration. </b> Unsatisfied with the available free sound effects, I sourced most of the sounds from free libraries, then edited and combined them to better fit the game's theme. I also handled the integration of VFX, models, animations, and other assets into the project.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Design Feedback and Suggestions. </b> As a prototype with no dedicated game design team, I had the opportunity to fill in design gaps based on feedback and my own judgment. I would often playtest features during development and refine them until they felt right, streamlining later feedback cycles and iteration.
