						<h3>About the app</h3>
						<p>
							The user flow of the app is pretty simple: after the image marker is scanned, a small stage spawns with an asset in the middle (a 3D model, for example).
							Below it, there is  a brief description and at the very bottom a pair of arrows to browse through them.
							After going through all of the assets, the user is prompted to click on the school’s logo to be redirected to the main page.
						</p>
						<h3>Making the app...</h3>
						<p>
							The goal for this project was to create an interactive Marker-based AR Poster to show what prospective students could learn in the VFS’ VR/AR program.
							We arrived at the conclusion that the most straightforward way of picking people’s interest and also informing them in an interactive way, was to showcase our own progress up to that point.
							It was one of our first times designing an interactive AR application, so a lot of time went into thinking of the most simple and intuitive way to display all the information and assets we wanted on a phone screen.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since it was only two of us, we also had to think of which of our projects were relevant and presentable enough to be displayed to everyone else while also maintaining our initial goal.
							One thing I like about this app is that it is highly scalable, because we can keep adding projects to it at any point.
