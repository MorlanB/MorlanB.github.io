						<h3>Creating the app...</h3>
						<p>
							We mostly had fun when designing this game.
							While it is an obvious clone of the most popular VR Game there is, we took the idea and gave it a twist!
							The team members were either Korean or Mexican, so we just mixed both countriesâ€™ cultural traits and put them together in the game.
						</p>
						<p>
							We did face some challenges, like synchronizing the beat of the music with the fruit that was being spawned (in-game time seems to work differently from the music-playing one, so it leads to desynchronization).
							 Optimization of the assets was another important task to cover during development due to the way the mesh is cut and recreated at the moment it is being sliced.
