						<h3>About the Application</h3>
						<p>
							This environment is an example of how VR can be used to bring places to people instead of the other way around.
							In this specific case, the purpose is to give the user an idea of what an apartment suit would look like without having to go there.
							They can see the place during daylight or at nighttime, change the lighting and access useful information all in the same environment.
						</p>
						<h3>The process...</h3>
						<p>
							An unlit apartment was provided to me to start working with. First, I set up the project so it could be used in VR.
							Then, I created a sublevel for each time of the day and built the lighting for each.
							For the user to be able to control which lighting sublevel was going to overlap the apartment, I created a widget with a checkbox and a slider.
							While the checkbox was to toggle the daytime settings, the slider was to set the brightness of all lights in the environment.
						
						</p>
						<p>
							For the sound, I used Unreal Engineâ€™s default audio managing tools and played around with the attenuation assets. The goal was to give it a cozy feeling that would fit the scene.
							The icons in the widgets as well as the splash and icon of the app were all created in Krita.
